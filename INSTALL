Installing NASTY
----------------

A) Installation and preparation of MySQL:

1. Install mysql 4.1 or higher, see file SSL-INSTALL for adding SSL capabilities

2. Create database "nasty" and tables needed by nasty:
	mysql < prepare.mysql	

3. In case you want to install the Tomcat-based GUI:
   - Insert user and password into 'users' table of the nasty database
   - Insert same user and role 'admin' into 'user_roles' table
   The user and password are used for login to the GUI.

   Example:
   mysql> insert into user_roles ('nasty_user', 'admin');
   mysql> insert into users values ('nasty_user', 'password');

----------------

B) Installation and praparation of Tomcat (for the GUI):

1. Install Tomcat 5.0 or higher

2. Copy mysql-connector-java-3.0.16-ga-bin.jar to $TOMCAT_HOME/common/lib

3. Uncomment SSL-Connector in $TOMCAT_HOME/conf/server.xml to allow 
   SSL-Connections

4. Generate key as described in $TOMCAT_HOME/conf/server.xml

----------------

C) Building the IPFIX collector:

1. Edit build_nastyCollector.sh and adapt $JAVA_HOME if necessary

2. Execute build_nastyCollector.sh and follow the instructions given at the end

----------------

D) Building the GUI:

1. Have a look at tomcat_content/META-INF/context.xml and make necessary changes.

2. Edit build_gui.sh and adapt $JAVA_HOME if necessary

3. Execute build_gui.sh and follow the instructions given at the end.
   
4. Use a browser and open http://localhost:8080/nasty 

----------------

E) Building and installation of both collector and GUI with the old script:

1. Have a look at tomcat_content/META-INF/context.xml and make necessary changes.

2. Run install.sh and follow the instructions given at the end.

NOTE: install.sh creates a /usr/local/nastyCollector directory
      and a script called nastyColl in /usr/local/bin
      (therefore, you need to be root to run install.sh)
 
3. Run the nastyColl script (at the moment only root can do that) to start 
   the data collection and visit http://localhost:8080/nasty (or http://localhost:8084/nasty) to see 
   the web interface.
